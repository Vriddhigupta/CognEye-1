## Description
Add your project description here. Your project description should cover how your project works. That way you can convey what your project is without the need for anyone to view the code. A more detailed readme in your project repository is encouraged, which can include build and use instructions etc.

* Use bullet points for any feature descriptions you may want to add

```bash
    Add appropriate code snippets here (4 spaces indent)
```

Don't forget to replace the link here with **_your own Github repository_** link.

Along with this, add the link of the drive folder that contains the app APK/Screenshots/Screen Recordings. If you have hosted your project on the web, add that link as well.

## Applications
>CognEye will act as bridge for visually impaired people to see the world through the features like object detection, optical character recognition, facial recognition, etc.
>CognEye will activate camera and voice technologies in smartphones, to identify objects, letters, paragraph, etc around the user.
>It will also provides a inbuilt voice assitance to help the user with understanding the app features and its use.

## What team members learned from this project



1. **Jaivanti Dhokey:** "Working with cogneye team was an amazing learning experience for me. Right from brainstorming various ideas and implementing them to deploying ML Models and entire website, Learning more about web development and ML field, has added a lot of wisdom to explore more deeply in this field."
2. **Atharva Alshi:** "Working with the team on this project was a wonderful experience.I along with my teammate Sanika implemented ML model Object Detection using ML-kit.Using TextToSpeech intent we implemented it on our model so the app speaks which object is has detected.Overall experience was really amazing and got to learn alot from the other group members as well. "
3. **Sanika Gadge:** "Overall this was a very great experience. I along with my team-mate Atharva maily focused on the object detection feature for the application. We integrated a pre-trained Tensorflow object detection model to our UI. Along with that implementing text to speech in Android to convert the labels into voice notes. I learnt alot of new things like getting a small intoduction to android studio. Working on the website was also a great learning experience along with Jayvanti and Atharva. I'll like to thank SkillUp for providing us with this opportunity and opening new areas of learning."
4. **Vriddhi Gupta:** - "It was a surreal experience for me. While working on this project I learnt implemenating ML models like facial recognition model. We couldn't use API for facial recognition feature since all were paid , hence I along with my partner Krishna implmented the entire facial recognition program from scratch but we could not add  this feature into our app because we still need to implement server client feature in order to use this model with the app. It was a great expereince while working on the UI with my UI team. I learnt the fact that as a part of a team we should always be ready to help each other."

5. **Purva Anjarlekar:** "I had just started learning ML when I joined this group project. It helped me a lot with implementation and understanding concepts. We specifically didn't work on developing a model but learning to work with APIs and integrating it with the app was very interesting to do. Thank you for this opportunity provided by SkillUp compelling me to study the subject."
## Future scope
>We will deploy the facial recognition model that is already implemented.
>Voice activation for opening the app and using it's feature can be also added to this app making it easy to use for visually impaired people.
